<!--Title above may need to be changed since it's only one of 2 options provided here
**Issue #20 Government context requirements:**  NSS needs to be updated, non-manual method by enterprise engineer, no intervention needed by users, certutil or other methods to manage **_enterprise configurations_ for NSS**.  

**Issue #20 Questions we have to answer/resolve:**
* Some of the intermediate CAs in the FPKI stop the CA name at OU rather than using a CN. What is the solution?
* Do full chains for client (user)-provided certificates need to be configured in the client for two-way TLS to succeed?-->

Firefox doesn't use the Windows trust store by default, which forces you to manually add your CA certificates to the NSS trust store. There are solutions! This guide gives you two ways to fix this across your enterprise:

* [Configure Firefox To Use the Windows Trust Store](#configure-firefox-to-use-the-windows-trust-store)
* [Automate Importing CA Certificates into the NSS Trust Store with Certutil](#automate-importing-ca-certificates-into-the-nss-trust-store-with-certutil)

## Configure Firefox To Use the Windows Trust Store

You can configure Firefox to use the Windows trust store<!--Is "file"="trust store"?-->: [Experimental Built-in Windows Support for Firefox Version 49 and Later](https://wiki.mozilla.org/CA:AddRootToFirefox){target="_blank"}_. You'll need to import the agency's root chain certificates into the Windows trust store.<!--??? "root chain certificates or "CA certificates" (title of doc.)? Shouldn't they already be in the Windows trust store? Unclear meaning.--> 

For Firefox to use the Windows trust store, you'll need to set the _security.enterprise_roots.enabled_ to _true_. For additional steps, go to:  [Firefox preference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Preferences/A_brief_guide_to_Mozilla_preferences){target="_blank"}. You can make this change enterprise-wide.

{% include info-alert.hmtl content="If you set this preference on a client machines, the users won't be able to change it." %}

#### Client Machines <!--Is this an enterprise-management solution? See LaChelle's requirement for enterprise management in Issue #20 thread.-->

You can create a JavaScript and put it into your users' Firefox profile directories so the JavaScript will run whenever a user launches Firefox. <!--Add a link to the Mozilla details about Firefox profiles.  Where is the user's Firefox directory and how does the admin place it in the directory? Mozilla procedures I found had steps that didn't work.-->

```
JavaScript
// Set Firefox to trust the Windows trust file
lockPref("security.enterprise_roots.enabled", true);
```
* Restart Firefox.<!--Mozilla procedures said user would have to toggle off/on or restart Firefox to enable this preference.-->

#### Enterprise-wide

You can also make this change across your agency's enterprise: [Enterprise Deployment of Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Enterprise_deployment){target="_blank"}_.

## Automate Importing CA Certificates into the NSS Trust Store Using _Certutil_

Using _certutil_ is a way to automate importing CA certificates into the NSS trust store.

### Prerequisites

1. Install the Firefox NSS _certutil_ on your client machines. Go to: [Firefox-Add Certs](https://github.com/christian-korneck/firefox_add-certs/releases){target="_blank"}_.
2. Client machines configured for PIV login.  

### Automate Importing CA Certificates into the NSS Trust Store

1. Using a Domain Controller, copy the CA certificate to the NSS directory so you can access it via _\\fileserver\scripts$\comp_resources\nss\publicca.cer_.
2. Open the Group Policy Management Console: _gpmc.msc_. 
3. Create and edit a Group Policy Object (GPO) using a test _OU_ (i.e., your target).
4. Navigate to User _Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Scripts\._ 
5. Double-click on _Logon_ and then click on _Show files_.
6. Create a new BAT file named _firefox_ca_add.bat_ that contains: 

            if not exist "%appdata%\mozilla\firefox\profiles" goto:eof
            set profiledir=%appdata%\mozilla\firefox\profiles
            dir "%profiledir%" /a:d /b > "%temp%\temppath.txt"
            if not exist "c:\windows\syswow64\nss" goto WIN32
            for /f "tokens=*" %%i in (%temp%\temppath.txt) do (
            cd /d "%profiledir%\%%i"
            copy cert8.db cert8.db.orig /y
            "c:\windows\syswow64\nss\certutil.exe" -A -n "Our Organization's Root CA" -i "c:\windows\system32\nss\publicca.cer" -t "TCu,TCu,TCu" -d . 
            )
            goto FINALLY
            :WIN32
            if not exist "c:\windows\system32\nss" goto FINALLY
            for /f "tokens=*" %%i in (%temp%\temppath.txt) do (
            cd /d "%profiledir%\%%i"
            copy cert8.db cert8.db.orig /y
            "c:\windows\system32\nss\certutil.exe" -A -n "Our Organization's Root CA" -i "c:\windows\system32\nss\publicca.cer" -t "TCu,TCu,TCu" -d . 
            )
            goto FINALLY
            :FINALLY
            del /f /q "%temp%\temppath.txt"

7. Go to the Logon Properties window and click _Add_.
8. Browse to and double-click on the _firefox_ca_add.bat file_.
9. Double-click on _Logoff_ and go through Steps 5-8 again; however, this time use the directory tree to navigate to the BAT file (script) you created in Step 6 (e.g., C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup). 
10. Perform a _gpupdate /force_ on the test client machine and restart it. (You can also just run the BAT file.)
11. Open Firefox and go to _Tools_ **>** _Options_ **>** _Advanced_ **>** _Encryption_ tab **>** _Certificates_ pane. Click the _View Certificates button_. 
12. Scroll to [your organizationâ€™s] Root CA.
13. Remove an issued CA certificate: 

```

cd /d "%profiledir%\%%i"
"c:\windows\syswow64\nss\certutil.exe" -D -n "Our Organization's Root CA" -d 
```
