PIV Engineering Guides are to help engineers configure and administer agency applications for using PIV for authentication. These guides are intended to be technical and include procedures to configure a system.  These guides are specific to the US Federal Government and PIV credentials.

Examples of engineering guide topics:

* How do I enable PIV or CAC for SSH to a Unix-like system?
* How do I use PIV or CAC with a mainframe?
* How do I enable Firefox to allow the use of PIV?
* Code samples for accessing information on a PIV credential
* Common scripts or tools that are government developed and open source for the public domain

You can [contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/) to this effort or open an [Issue]({{site.repo_url}}/issues) to discuss a need you may have for a guide.
