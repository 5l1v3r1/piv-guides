The PIV Developer Guides are provided to help engineers configure agency applications to require PIV authentication. These guides are intended to be technical and include step-by-step procedures to develop or configure a system. They should be specific to US Federal Government and PIV credentials.

We are gathering developer guides and invite you to contribute.

Examples of developer guide topics:

* How do I use PIV for Secure Shell (SSH)?
* Lessons learned for enabling Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to allow PIV.
* How do I use PIV with a mainframe?
* How do I enable a website to use PIV?
* How do I enable a domain to assert assurance in the Kerberos tickets?
* Code samples for accessing information on a PIV credential.
* Common scripts or tools that are government-developed and open source for the public domain.

You can [contribute]({{ site.baseurl }}/contribute/) to this effort or open an [Issue]({{site.repo_url}}/issues) to discuss a need you may have for a developer guide.
